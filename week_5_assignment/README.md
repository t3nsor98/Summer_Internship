# Week 4: Full Stack Integration (Connecting MERN)

Welcome to Week 4 of the Next Gen Software Hub Pvt. Ltd. MERN Bootcamp!  
This week is focused on integrating the frontend and backend in a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application.

---

## PLANS

- **Connect React frontend with Express backend**
  - Learn how to make API requests from your React application to an Express server.
  - Understand how data flows between the client and the server.

- **Implement Redux Toolkit for state management (optional)**
  - Use Redux Toolkit to manage and centralize application state.
  - Simplify state logic, especially for larger applications.

- **Build a Task Manager App (CRUD functionality)**
  - Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks using a full-stack approach.
  - Practice handling data persistence and UI updates.

---

## Resources

- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [Axios Guide](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

---

## What You Will Learn

- How to set up and connect a React frontend to an Express backend.
- How to perform CRUD operations through RESTful APIs.
- (Optionally) How to manage complex state using Redux Toolkit.
- How to use Axios for making HTTP requests from the frontend.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Backend (Express + MongoDB):**
   - Set up an Express server.
   - Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.
   - Create RESTful routes for tasks (CRUD).

2. **Frontend (React):**
   - Build UI components for listing, adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
   - Use Axios to communicate with the backend API.

3. **(Optional) Redux Toolkit:**
   - Set up Redux Toolkit for global state management.
   - Use slices and async thunks for handling tasks and API calls.

---

## Example Features

- Display a list of tasks (Read)
- Add a new task (Create)
- Edit an existing task (Update)
- Delete a task (Delete)

Happy Coding!
