# Week 3: Database (MongoDB \& Mongoose)

Welcome to Week 3 of your Summer Internship at Next Gen Software Hub Pvt. Ltd.! This week focuses on databases, specifically MongoDB and Mongoose, to help you build robust backend applications with proper data persistence and authentication.

## Overview

This week builds upon your Express.js knowledge from Week 2, adding database functionality and user authentication to create complete backend systems. You'll learn how to store, retrieve, update, and delete data persistently while implementing secure user authentication.

## Learning Objectives

### Learn MongoDB (CRUD operations, Mongoose Schema)

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. During this week, you will:

- Master the fundamentals of document-based databases
- Learn to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations
- Understand how to structure data with Mongoose schemas
- Practice data modeling and validation techniques
- Explore MongoDB's querying capabilities


### Connect Express.js backend to MongoDB

Building on your Express.js knowledge, you'll now:

- Set up database connections in your Node.js applications
- Implement proper error handling for database operations
- Create data models that integrate with your API endpoints
- Learn best practices for organizing database code
- Understand the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern


### Build a User Authentication System (JWT + Bcrypt)

Security is crucial for web applications. You'll implement:

- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication
- Bcrypt for secure password hashing
- User registration and login flows
- Protected routes that require authentication
- Token validation and refresh mechanisms


## Resources

To support your learning journey, we recommend these key resources:

- **MongoDB Docs**: Comprehensive documentation for MongoDB, covering installation, CRUD operations, queries, and more.
- **Mongoose Guide**: Official guide for Mongoose, the elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.


## Project Ideas

Consider building one of these projects to practice your skills:

1. User management system with authentication
2. Simple blog API with posts and comments
3. Task/todo list application with user accounts
4. Product inventory system

## Getting Started

1. Install MongoDB on your development machine
2. Set up a new Express project or continue from Week 2
3. Add Mongoose to your project: `npm install mongoose`
4. Install authentication packages: `npm install jsonwebtoken bcrypt`
5. Create your first schema and connect to MongoDB

## Next Steps

By the end of Week 3, you should have a functioning Express.js application connected to MongoDB with user authentication. This will prepare you for more advanced topics in the coming weeks.

Happy coding!
